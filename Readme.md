Then you clone this config with command:

> Unix, Linux

```bash
# This will git clone the neovim-config to your system path
git clone https://github.com/jinzhongjia/neovim-config ~/.cofig/nvim
```

2. **Open Nvim To Auto Configurate**

Now, you just need to use this command `nvim` to open neovim!

And then you will see that message which tell you missing a lot of plugins, dont worry, just press `ENTER` to continue, then the `packer` will Automatically install all plugins.

That looks cool, doesn't it?

3. \*\*Exit And Reopen Neovim

Exit and reopen neovim, it will auto install the lsp, dap, null-ts, treesitter dependencies!
