## what is this ?

this is my neovim config, and 100% lua!

## notice

now, many dependent packages are installed by nixos's pkgs manager, if you want to use my config, you maybe need to install dependence manually!

I will list the required dependencies in a while, you can install the required dependencies according to this very convenient!
